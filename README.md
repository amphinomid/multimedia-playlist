Music is my favorite medium because it transcends genre. Songs become snapshots of everything I remember about the time I spent listening to them.

This project is an effort to capture all I can about my favorite songs. At first, I planned to create a webpage with snippets of their lyrics, until I realized this would condense music into words, when instead I wanted to augment.

The final version combines lyrics and quotes, embedded Spotify players and graphics. Adding graphics compelled me to think about the ways I relive music: by season, time, place. Iâ€™d spent the summer that I made this biking around my hometown of Little Rock along the Arkansas River; it was the first pandemic summer, the summer my hometown became more important to me than ever. The graphics I created were an homage to my city. The result is a playlist-as-a-diary of sorts.
